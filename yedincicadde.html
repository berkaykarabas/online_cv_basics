        "During my university years, I created a website called www.yedincicadde.com.<br> This website was an e-commerce project under the umbrella of a social responsibility initiative, where housewives could sell the
products they made at home.<br> Throughout this venture, I had the opportunity to interact with numerous
mentors, investors, and various individuals.<br>
The main goal of the project was to support local artisans and promote their handmade products while
contributing to the community.<br> It was a platform where individuals could showcase their creativity and
entrepreneurial spirit.<br> As the founder, I was responsible for managing the website, coordinating with sellers,
and ensuring a smooth user experience for both buyers and sellers.<br>
One of the notable milestones during this journey was participating in the ITU Tekno ArÄ±kent Competition,
which aimed to foster innovation and entrepreneurship.<br> Although we did not achieve any awards or
recognition in the competition, the experience itself was invaluable. It allowed me to refine my
entrepreneurial skills, learn from industry experts, and receive valuable feedback on our project.<br>
Moreover, our social responsibility project gained recognition from local authorities and was supported by
the Uskudar Entrepreneurship Academy, which provided us with a virtual office space and resources to
further develop our initiative.<br>
This experience taught me the importance of perseverance, teamwork, and adaptability.<br> It highlighted the
significance of networking and seeking guidance from mentors and professionals in the field.<br> Above all, it
reinforced my belief in the power of social entrepreneurship to create a positive impact in society.
Looking back, I am proud of the journey we embarked on with www.yedincicadde.com.<br> Although it may not
have resulted in immediate success, the lessons learned and the connections made during this
entrepreneurial endeavor have laid a solid foundation for my future endeavors.<br> I am excited to continue
exploring the world of entrepreneurship, making a difference, and pursuing projects that align with my
passion for social responsibility."<br>
